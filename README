tmo.c example 

This simple example uses the MongoDB C Driver, pthreads and libcurl to fetch documents and insert into MongoDB. Parallel processing allows Documents to be retreived and stored simultaneously. 

URLs are loaded into a global array urls[]. A pointer to the index of each URL is passed to fetch and callback functions.

I have tried this sample code with up to 100 URLs, however the user should take care not to blow up their system with too many threads. 

There is limited error handling in this simple example. There also appears to be a condition where certain characters, or perhaps document encoding, cause a segfault on insert. Checking into this.

In a future example I will include code for parsing and manipulation of fetched data.
